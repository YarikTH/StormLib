# Purpose
The main purpose of current fork is cleaning up repository from lots of trash and preparing cross platform build process properly.
After it I can use it as conan package to work with MPQ archives on every supported platform.

# Todo
[ ] add trivial unit testing
[ ] add travis and appveyor recipes to test working on diferent platforms
[ ] investigate stormlib_dll folder and maybe start work without hardcoded exp file from it
[ ] think about using conan to deal with dependencies
